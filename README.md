# Amazon Bedrock and Generative AI

In this course, principal cloud technologist **Lee Assam** introduces Amazon Bedrock, offering a foundational understanding of Generative AI and how **foundation models (FMs)** solve problems like text summarization, semantic/conversational search, and content generation. Using tools such as **Python boto3**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**, you'll learn to build Generative AI applications that leverage **Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs)** using APIs without managing infrastructure. Explore pre-built FMs in Amazon Bedrock and practice building a basic Gen AI application to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Key Highlights:
- Explore **Amazon Bedrock** pre-built models and features.
- Learn to integrate with APIs using **boto3** and **LangChain**.
- Build a Generative AI application with **Streamlit**.
